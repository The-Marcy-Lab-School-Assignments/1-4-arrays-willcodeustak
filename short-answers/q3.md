# Question

Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer

The rest operator is used in the parameter of a function to collect all incoming inputs into an array. Whereas, the spread operator is used to take all the elements in an exisiting array and capture them into a cloned array.

#### Rest Operator

```js
const printNums = (...numbers) => {
  //...numbers is the rest operator collecting incoming inputs into an array called "numbers'
  console.log(numbers);
};
printNums(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
```

### Spread Operator

```js
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const changeNums = (numbers) => {
  let newArray = [...numbers]; // [...numbers] is the spread operator which helps us clone existing array elements inside a new array without affecting the original incoming input array.
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(numbers[i] + 2);
  }
  return newArray;
};
changeNums(nums);
```
