# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer

No, `addBostonToFavorites` is not a pure function because it is altering the `favoriteLocations` array by using the `.shift()` method on it. To make it pure, you would have to clone the `locations` parameter via the `...spread` operator and return the newly created array inside the function (that doesn't affect `favoriteLocations`).

# Teacher Feedback

Small correction, love that you said `location` parameter, you can also say `location` array.
